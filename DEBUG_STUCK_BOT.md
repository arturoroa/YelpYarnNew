# Debugging Python Bot Getting Stuck

## Updated Script with Better Debug Output

I've added detailed logging throughout the Python bot to help identify where it's getting stuck. Now you'll see:

✅ `Initializing Chrome WebDriver...`
✅ `Running in VISIBLE mode (browser will open)`
✅ `WebDriver initialized successfully`
✅ `Navigating to Yelp signup page...`
✅ `Page loaded, waiting 2 seconds...`
✅ `Detecting form type...`
✅ `Form type detected: DIRECT/MODAL`
✅ `Filling form fields...`
✅ Progress for each field: `Filling First Name with: John`

## How to Find Where It's Stuck

### Run the test script:

```cmd
test_bot_visible.bat
```

### Watch the console output carefully

The **LAST line printed** before it hangs will tell you exactly where it's stuck. Common scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Stuck on "Initializing Chrome WebDriver..."

**Problem:** ChromeDriver not found or Chrome browser not installed

**Solution:**
```cmd
# Download ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
# Place chromedriver.exe in backend\automation\ folder
```

### Scenario 2: Stuck on "Navigating to Yelp signup page..."

**Problem:** Network issue or Chrome can't open the page

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Try opening https://www.yelp.com/signup manually in Chrome
- Check if firewall is blocking Chrome

### Scenario 3: Stuck on "Detecting form type..."

**Problem:** Page elements not loading or Yelp changed their HTML structure

**Solution:**
- Wait longer for page to load
- Check if the browser window shows the signup form
- Look for any error messages in the browser

### Scenario 4: Stuck on "Filling [Field Name] with: [value]"

**Problem:** Specific field selector not working (Yelp changed their HTML)

**Example output:**
```
Filling First Name with: John
[STUCK HERE - no more output]
```

**What this means:**
- The script found the page
- It's trying to fill the "First Name" field
- But it can't find the field with the current selector
- It's waiting up to 30 seconds (timeout) before giving up

**Solution:**
- Look at the browser window - is the signup form visible?
- If yes, the HTML selector might have changed
- Take a screenshot and share it

### Scenario 5: Stuck after "All fields filled successfully!"

**Problem:** The 5-second delay is running

**This is NORMAL!** The browser will:
- Stay open for 5 seconds so you can see the result
- Then close automatically
- Print the JSON result

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Test with output to file (to capture what was printed):

```cmd
python backend\automation\yelp_signup_bot.py --mode automatic > output.txt 2>&1
```

Then open `output.txt` to see where it stopped.

### 2. Test with shorter timeout (10 seconds instead of 30):

```cmd
python backend\automation\yelp_signup_bot.py --mode automatic --timeout 10
```

### 3. Test with headless mode (faster, no window):

```cmd
python backend\automation\yelp_signup_bot.py --mode automatic --headless
```

## What to Share When Asking for Help

1. **Last line printed** before it got stuck
2. **Screenshot** of the browser window (if it opened)
3. **Full console output** (copy/paste or from output.txt)
4. **Your Chrome version** (chrome://version/)
5. **Your ChromeDriver version** (if you downloaded it)

## Common Fixes

### ✅ Selenium not installed
```cmd
pip install selenium
```

### ✅ ChromeDriver not found
Download from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Place in: `backend\automation\chromedriver.exe`

### ✅ Chrome version mismatch
ChromeDriver version MUST match your Chrome browser version

### ✅ Script stuck waiting for element
- Increase timeout: `--timeout 60`
- Or Yelp changed their HTML (report the issue)

## Still Stuck?

Run this and share the output:

```cmd
python backend\automation\yelp_signup_bot.py --mode automatic --timeout 10 > debug.txt 2>&1
```

Then open `debug.txt` and share the contents!
